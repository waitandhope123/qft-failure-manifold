# Toy 001 — Schwarzschild Baseline Exploration

This toy simulates the Schwarzschild spacetime, a spherically symmetric vacuum solution in General Relativity, focusing on static observers and radial light propagation. It computes quantities like the Kretschmann scalar, tidal eigenvalues, time dilation, radial null cone slopes, and gravitational redshift, for sample radii $r$ outside the event horizon at $r = 2M$. For example, the Kretschmann scalar is given by $$K = \frac{48 M^2}{r^6}$$ which diverges at the true singularity $r \to 0$, illustrating the geometric curvature independent of coordinates.

The toy exists to highlight conceptual distinctions and stress-test coordinate expressions. Schwarzschild coordinates become ill-behaved at the horizon, $r = 2M$, so quantities like static time dilation $d\tau/dt = \sqrt{1 - 2M/r}$ or radial null slopes $dr/dt = \pm(1 - 2M/r)$ cannot be trusted there or inside. This exposes the limitations of naive coordinate-time observables while confirming that frame-invariant diagnostics, such as tidal eigenvalues or curvature scalars, remain well-defined and finite outside the singularity, demonstrating the separation between coordinate artifacts and true physical divergences.

The JSON results provide sampled values for radii ranging from just above the horizon to far outside it, listing curvature invariants, tidal eigenvalues, time dilation, and observables like gravitational redshift and round-trip coordinate light time. Trends such as decreasing Kretschmann values and tidal magnitudes with increasing $r$, or decreasing redshift $z$ for distant emitters, illustrate expected fall-off behaviors. Null cone slopes and time dilation approaching unity at large $r$ confirm asymptotic flatness. Individual numeric values should not be over-interpreted as precise physical predictions; rather, they serve to connect the computed JSON outputs conceptually back to the formulas, highlighting divergence near $r \to 0$, coordinate pathologies at $r = 2M$, and the general scaling of gravitational effects with radius.
