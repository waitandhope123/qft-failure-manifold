## Toy 041 — State-Dependent Backreaction in a Mean-Field Scalar Field

This toy simulates a simple scalar quantum field in a finite volume where the field’s own fluctuations feed back into its effective mass. The setup tracks how an initially free mass parameter $m_0$ is modified when a mean-field estimate of the field variance $\langle \phi^2 \rangle$ is included, producing a time-dependent effective mass through $$m_\mathrm{eff}^2 = m_0^2 + \lambda \langle \phi^2 \rangle,$$ where $\lambda$ is a fixed coupling. Two nearly identical initial quantum states, differing only in their mode occupation numbers, are evolved side by side to expose how this feedback alters the quantity of interest, namely the effective mass.

The toy exists to illustrate a conceptual pressure point rather than to predict physical dynamics. Once expectation values are allowed to influence parameters, the evolution becomes explicitly state-dependent: there is no single, invariant Hamiltonian that applies to all states. This demonstrates a limitation of naive extensions of linear quantum dynamics, showing how even weak backreaction breaks state independence in a controlled Hartree approximation. The construction is therefore a stress test for the idea of a universal generator of time evolution, not a claim about the true behavior of interacting quantum fields.

The JSON output should be read as a comparison between the two chosen initial states. At each sampled time coordinate, the fields `m_eff_state_A` and `m_eff_state_B` report the self-consistent effective masses, while `delta_m_eff` highlights their difference. The important feature is not the absolute value of these numbers, which quickly settle to nearly constant plateaus, but the persistent nonzero separation between the two states despite identical bare parameters. This separation reflects the feedback encoded in the equation for $m_\mathrm{eff}$; it should not be over-interpreted as a physical mass shift or time evolution, but only as evidence that the mean-field prescription ties the dynamics to the chosen quantum state.

## Toy 042 — Tracing Out Degrees of Freedom and Non-Unitary Subsystem Dynamics

This toy evolves a coupled pair of truncated harmonic oscillators (A and B) as a closed system, but reports what an observer restricted to oscillator A would infer. The global state evolves by a unitary step generated by a fixed Hamiltonian on the four-dimensional basis $\{|00\rangle,|01\rangle,|10\rangle,|11\rangle\}$, while the subsystem description is obtained by tracing out B to form the reduced density matrix $\rho_A = \mathrm{Tr}_B(\rho)$. The quantities of interest are then the von Neumann entropy of A, $S_A = -\mathrm{Tr}(\rho_A \log \rho_A)$, and the purity $\mathrm{Tr}(\rho_A^2)$, which together summarize how mixed (and thus how effectively “decohered”) the subsystem state becomes.

The toy exists to stress-test the assumption that every subsystem can be assigned its own invariant Hamiltonian generating unitary time evolution. Even when the full A+B system follows perfectly unitary dynamics, the reduced dynamics of A generally cannot: tracing out B discards correlations, and those correlations reappear as apparent information loss for A. This demonstrates a failure mode of “local” unitary evolution as a universal principle: the subsystem’s evolution depends on entanglement with unobserved degrees of freedom, so treating A as closed is conceptually ambiguous and can mislead if interpreted as a fundamental prediction rather than a limitation being exposed.

In the JSON, each entry in `sample_points` gives a time `t` and the subsystem observables `entropy_subsystem_A` and `purity_subsystem_A`. Read rising entropy (away from 0) together with decreasing purity (away from 1) as the signature that A is becoming mixed due to entanglement with B, not due to any explicit noise term or non-Hermitian Hamiltonian; at $t=0$ the toy starts in a product vacuum with $S_A \approx 0$ and purity $=1$, while by the final time ($t=10.0$ here) it reports $S_A \approx 0.262$ and purity $\approx 0.864$. What should not be over-interpreted is the absolute magnitude of the entropy or its detailed oscillations as a physical decoherence rate: this is a finite-dimensional truncation and a proxy model, so the numbers are best treated as indicators of “how mixed” $\rho_A$ is, connecting back to the definition of $S_A$ and the fact that $\rho_A$ is computed via $\rho_A = \mathrm{Tr}_B(\rho)$ from an underlying pure global state.

## Toy 043 — Loschmidt Echo and Sensitivity to Hamiltonian Perturbations

This toy evolves the same initial quantum state under two nearly identical Hamiltonians and measures how distinguishable the resulting states become over time. The physical setup is a minimal two-level system, evolved once with a base Hamiltonian and once with a slightly perturbed version, and the quantity of interest is the Loschmidt echo, defined as $$L(t) = |\langle \psi(t) | \psi_\epsilon(t) \rangle|^2,$$ which measures the squared overlap between the two evolved states. When $L(t)=1$ the states are operationally identical, while smaller values indicate growing distinguishability despite starting from the same initial condition.

The toy exists to expose a structural fragility of quantum dynamics rather than to model chaos or decoherence in any realistic sense. It illustrates that there is no invariant notion of “the same dynamics” once the Hamiltonian is even infinitesimally altered: two generators that differ by a tiny perturbation can produce trajectories that separate in Hilbert space. This is framed as a stress test of dynamical stability, highlighting an ambiguity in comparing evolutions when the Hamiltonian is not specified exactly, rather than as a physical claim about irreversibility or thermalization.

The JSON output should be read as a time series of the Loschmidt echo and its complement, the fidelity decay $1-L(t)$. The key feature to notice is that although the echo remains numerically close to one throughout, it systematically departs from unity and oscillates, reflecting sensitivity to the perturbation parameter $\epsilon$ encoded in the Hamiltonian. What matters is the trend away from perfect overlap, not the precise oscillatory pattern or the final numerical value, which depend on discretization and the simplicity of the model. These values should not be over-interpreted as exponential decay rates or signatures of chaos; they simply connect back to the definition of $L(t)$ as an overlap measure and demonstrate how small Hamiltonian differences manifest as measurable state distinguishability.

## Toy 044 — KMS Condition and Thermal Time Ambiguity

This toy takes a fixed density matrix for a two-level quantum system and tests whether it looks “thermal” under different choices of time evolution. Concretely, it prepares $\rho$ to be thermal with respect to one Hamiltonian $H_1$ (at inverse temperature $\beta$), then computes a two-point correlator of a probe operator $A$ evolved in time by either $H_1$ or a different Hamiltonian $H_2$. The diagnostic is whether the correlator respects the KMS periodicity under an imaginary-time shift, schematically comparing $C_H(t)=\mathrm{Tr}(\rho\,A(t)A)$ to its shifted version at $t+i\beta$.

The toy exists to expose that “being at temperature $1/\beta$” is not a property of the state alone, but of the pair (state, time generator). The KMS condition is defined relative to the dynamics used to define $A(t)$, so the same $\rho$ can satisfy KMS for one Hamiltonian while failing it for another, even if the two Hamiltonians are close. This is a stress test of the idea that temperature is an invariant label of a state: the toy demonstrates that thermality is not structurally stable under changing the notion of time flow, rather than making any claim about real thermalization.

In the JSON, each `sample_points` entry reports at time `t` two scalars: `KMS_violation_H1` and `KMS_violation_H2`, which are the magnitudes of the mismatch $|C_H(t)-C_H(t+i\beta)|$ for evolution by $H_1$ and $H_2$ respectively. Here `KMS_violation_H1` stays at machine-precision zero (e.g., final value $\sim 1.1\times 10^{-16}$), indicating that $\rho$ is consistent with KMS when time is generated by the Hamiltonian that defined it, while `KMS_violation_H2` sits at an $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$ level (final value $\approx 0.256$), indicating a persistent failure under the alternate time flow. What should not be over-interpreted is the exact numerical plateau or its tiny fluctuations across `t`: these values are a finite-dimensional proxy and depend on the chosen probe operator and discretization, so the intended reading is only the qualitative contrast between “KMS-satisfying” and “KMS-violating” time generators, conceptually tied back to the imaginary-time shift by $i\beta$ in the KMS check.

## Toy 045 — Superposition of Semiclassical Sources and Expectation-Value Ambiguity

This toy illustrates a minimal quantum system in which a single operator is treated as a proxy for a classical source. The setup is a two-level quantum system with energy eigenstates and a chosen observable whose expectation value is interpreted as the quantity of interest. For any state $|\psi\rangle$, the sourced value is taken to be the expectation $\langle O\rangle=\langle\psi|O|\psi\rangle$, allowing a direct comparison between eigenstates, coherent superpositions, and classical mixtures within the same simple framework.

The purpose of the toy is to expose a conceptual limitation of semiclassical reasoning when expectation values are promoted to classical inputs. In such reasoning, one might implicitly assume that a superposition of quantum states corresponds to a weighted average of the classical sources associated with each state, as if $\langle O\rangle_{\text{sup}}$ should match a probabilistic mixture. The toy is a stress test of this assumption, highlighting that the mapping from quantum states to classical sources is state-dependent and not generally linear under superposition, even though it may accidentally agree in special cases.

The JSON results should be read as a direct numerical comparison of these notions. The eigenstate expectation values show equal and opposite signs, the classical mixture averages them to zero, and the coherent superposition yields its own expectation value, with the reported interference term measuring the difference between the two. Here that interference term is zero, demonstrating that the clash can be hidden for particular operators and states; this numerical agreement should not be over-interpreted as general validity. The values simply encode how $\langle\psi|O|\psi\rangle$ behaves for the chosen states and operator, and they conceptually tie back to the expectation-value equation rather than predicting any physical classical field.

## Toy 046 — Failure of Sharp Local Energy Density in Quantum Field Theory

This toy demonstrates how attempts to define a sharply local energy density break down even in a highly simplified quantum field setting. The model uses a single-mode approximation to a free scalar field in 1+1 dimensions and introduces a would-be local energy density that is only defined after smearing over space with a width $\sigma$. The quantity of interest is the vacuum expectation value of this smeared energy proxy, which in the toy takes the form $$E(\sigma)=\omega/(\sigma\sqrt{\pi})$$ where $\omega$ is the mode frequency and $\sigma$ controls how sharply the observable is localized.

The toy exists to illustrate a structural limitation rather than to model physical energy measurements. In quantum field theory, there is no invariant, sharply local stress-energy operator, and any attempt to localize energy necessarily introduces an external smearing scale. This construction stress-tests the idea that one could take a local energy density as a fundamental observable by showing that its expectation value depends explicitly on how localization is implemented and diverges as $\sigma\to 0$, signaling a conceptual failure rather than a prediction.

The JSON output should be interpreted as a comparison across different smearing widths. As the smearing width decreases, the reported smeared energy density increases in magnitude, with the smallest $\sigma$ producing the largest value, directly reflecting the $1/\sigma$ dependence in the expression for $E(\sigma)$. What matters are the monotonic trend and the divergence as localization is sharpened, not the absolute numerical values themselves. These numbers should not be over-interpreted as physical vacuum energies; they simply encode how the chosen smeared expectation value behaves and conceptually tie the reported magnitudes back to the smearing-dependent formula rather than to any sharp local observable.

## Toy 047 — Failure of an Instantaneous Ground State

This toy illustrates a single quantum harmonic oscillator whose frequency varies explicitly in time, $\omega(t)=\omega_0(1+\epsilon\sin t)$, used as a stand-in for a quantum field mode in a time-dependent background. The quantity of interest is the energy of the system as it evolves from an initial ground state defined at the starting frequency. At each time step, the toy compares the “instantaneous” ground-state energy $E_0(t)=\tfrac{1}{2}\omega(t)$ with the actual energy carried by the evolving state, highlighting how the two diverge even when the change in $\omega(t)$ is smooth.

The toy exists to expose a conceptual failure of adiabatic intuition: when the Hamiltonian depends on time, the notion of an instantaneous vacuum or ground state is not invariant. Although one might expect slow variation to keep the system near its ground state, the toy demonstrates that excitation is generically produced because the definition of particles and energy itself depends on the system’s history. This is a stress test of the idea that “the system stays in the ground state if changes are slow,” not a claim about real particle creation rates or a physically complete dynamical model.

The JSON results should be read as a time series of diagnostics rather than precise predictions. The key fields are the instantaneous ground energy, the state energy, and their difference (“excitation_above_ground”), which starts at zero and grows to a small but nonzero value by the end of the run. The important trend is the persistent positive offset $E-E_0$, signaling accumulated excitation relative to the instantaneous reference, not the detailed oscillations or the final numerical magnitude. These values should not be over-interpreted as real particle numbers; they simply encode, in proxy form, the conceptual statement that comparing $E=(n+\tfrac{1}{2})\omega(t)$ to $E_0(t)$ becomes ambiguous once the Hamiltonian itself is time-dependent.

## Toy 048 — Operator Ordering Ambiguity

This toy examines a single quantum harmonic oscillator prepared in its vacuum state and evaluates the same composite quantity using different operator orderings. The quantity of interest is built from position $x$ and momentum $p$, schematically of the form $x p^2$, but evaluated as $x p p$, $p x p$, $p p x$, and a Weyl-symmetrized average. By computing expectation values of these differently ordered operators in the same state, the toy isolates how the definition of an observable can depend on ordering even before any dynamics are considered.

The purpose of the toy is to illustrate a conceptual ambiguity rather than to make a physical prediction. In quantum field theory, composite operators are not uniquely defined without an ordering prescription, and different choices can lead to inequivalent numerical results. This toy is a stress test of the assumption that “the observable” is a well-defined object independent of conventions, exposing the limitation that operator ordering is part of the definition, not a secondary detail to be fixed later.

The JSON output should be interpreted as a comparison table for these ordering choices in a very specific state. Here all reported expectation values vanish, and the summary quantity “ordering_spread” is zero, indicating no visible difference between orderings in the vacuum for this simple setup. The important point is not the zero itself, but the fact that this equality is contingent on the chosen state and operators; it should not be over-interpreted as evidence that ordering never matters. Conceptually, the JSON values reflect expectation values $\langle\psi|O|\psi\rangle$ for different operator definitions $O$, and the toy demonstrates that agreement or disagreement between them is a contextual outcome, not a general guarantee.

## Toy 049 — Infrared Dressing and the Failure of Fock Particle Number

This toy models a single charged excitation coupled to long-wavelength (infrared) modes using a Bloch–Nordsieck–style proxy. The quantity of interest is the overlap between a “bare” Fock-space state and an infrared-dressed state, evaluated as a function of an infrared cutoff that controls how much soft radiation is included. Conceptually, the overlap is modeled as $|\langle\text{bare}|\text{dressed}\rangle|\sim\exp(-\alpha\ln(1/\lambda))$, where $\lambda$ is the infrared cutoff and $\alpha$ parametrizes the coupling to soft modes.

The toy exists to illustrate a structural limitation of particle language in quantum field theories with long-range interactions. In such theories, asymptotic states are infraparticles rather than sharp particle-number eigenstates, and the Fock-space notion of “one particle” is not invariant. This setup is a stress test of the assumption that particle number is a well-defined observable, exposing how infrared dressing alters the Hilbert-space overlap structure as the cutoff is lowered, rather than making any claim about real scattering amplitudes or physical cross sections.

The JSON output should be read as a monotonic trend rather than a precise quantitative statement. Each sample point reports the overlap between bare and dressed states at a given infrared cutoff, with the key signal being the steady decrease of this overlap as the cutoff is reduced. The absolute values and the specific minimum overlap reported should not be over-interpreted; what matters is the direction and persistence of the decay, indicating loss of overlap in the infrared limit. Conceptually, these numbers encode how the exponential suppression implied by the overlap formula manifests as $\lambda$ decreases, reinforcing that Fock-space particle number fails as a robust observable in the infrared.

## Toy 050 — Cross-toy Comparator as an Observable

This toy illustrates a meta-level operation: it takes multiple quantum field theory toy outputs and treats their comparison as the object of study. Rather than computing a field response or spectrum, it aligns the toys by their reported sample-point coordinates and records where each toy does or does not define data. The physical setup is therefore abstracted into a comparison space whose quantity of interest is overlap itself, formalized as the union of coordinate signatures $S = \bigcup_i S_i$, where each $S_i$ is the set of coordinates reported by toy $i$.

The toy exists to expose a common failure mode in interpretive claims about QFT, namely the assumption that different probes of a “shared concept” are automatically comparable. By construction, different toys may parameterize spacetime, modes, or observers differently, and their outputs may live on incompatible domains even when motivated by the same physical idea. This comparator frames that ambiguity as a stress test: disagreement, absence, or non-overlap is not an error to be smoothed over but the signal being illustrated, showing that conceptual equivalence does not imply operational equivalence.

The JSON results should be read as a map of presence rather than magnitude. Each entry in `sample_points` corresponds to a distinct coordinate signature, and the `present_in_files` flags indicate which input toys define data there. Trends to note are asymmetries and gaps—for example, coordinates indexed by `mode_index` appearing only in one toy, while trajectory-based coordinates appear only in another—while the total count of coordinate signatures quantifies the size of the combined comparison domain. What should not be over-interpreted are the empty curvature or observable fields: they are placeholders, not null physical results. Conceptually, the JSON encodes the set-theoretic structure implied by the union $S$, demonstrating where different toy constructions intersect or fail to intersect without asserting any physical truth about the underlying QFT.
